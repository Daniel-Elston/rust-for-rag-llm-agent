To resolve this issue, quantum cryptography was first introduced by Stephen Wiesner in 1983 [ 9 ], and then it was popularized about a year later with the first specific QKD protocol [ 10 ]. The main advantage of QKD is that it encodes information in properties of the individual quanta used for transmission instead of distributing classical information through radio frequency (RF) or free-space optical (FSO) signal modulation [ 11 ]. These quantum properties protect the encoded information from eavesdropper attacks via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle [ 12 ] and the No-Cloning Theorem [ 13 ], both of which are foundational principles in quantum mechanics. While there are a number of potentially \"quantum resistant\" algorithms [ 14 ] [ 15 ], the fact that QKD attributes its security to fundamental physical principles instead of computational complexity allows the QKD-based 1 arXiv:2501.08476v1 [quant-ph] 14 Jan 2025 Fig. 1"}, {"index": 2, "source": "data/raw/modeling-entanglement-based-quantum-key-distribution-for-the-nasa-quantum-comms-analysis-suite-2501.08476v1.pdf", "page_count": "9", "object_count": "350", "page_content": ". The National Quantum Initiative Act, signed into law in late 2018, provides a framework \u201cto accelerate quantum research and development for the economic and national security of the United States\u201d [ 2 ], encouraging universities to accelerate their efforts to increase the nation\u2019s QISE capabilities through a grand unification of quantum computing algorithms [ 3 ] and deeper dives into quantum networking [ 4 ]. Meanwhile, commercial entities are focusing more and more on the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers [ 5 ] and quantum AI [ 6 ]. The rise of viable quantum computers brings into question the sustainability of classical encryption methods. Most classical encryption methods rely on the mathematical complexity of large integer factorization to ensure security [ 7 ]; a complexity that may well become trivial with novel quantum phase estimation algorithms [ 8 ]"}], "model": "google/flan-t5-large"}
